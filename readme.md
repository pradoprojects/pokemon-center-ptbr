⚡ Case Study: Pokémon Center Localization (PT-BR)

🎯 Objective
To demonstrate a strategic localization and UX approach for the Pokémon Center e-commerce platform, specifically targeting the Brazilian market. This study addresses the current "Experience Gap" between brand engagement and retail conversion for Portuguese-speaking fans.

💡 The Business Case: The "Brazilian Gap"
Current Landscape: While TPCi maintains a strong digital presence in Brazil via pokemon.com/br, the official retail arm (pokemoncenter.com) lacks PT-BR localization and regional support for South America.

Strategic Opportunity: Thousands of high-purchasing-power Brazilian fans travel annually to the US, UK, and Germany (regions where the Pokémon Center operates). The 2026 World Cup in the USA will significantly amplify this foot traffic.

The Solution: A localized digital interface reduces friction for "Global Travelers," allowing fans to navigate product specs, checkout flows, and brand-exclusive collections in their native language, maximizing retail revenue during global events.

🛠️ Technical Workflow & Methodology
CAT Tool Proficiency: Full workflow executed in MemoQ, ensuring terminology consistency, QA, and tag protection.

UX Writing & UI Constraints: Careful adaptation of navigation menus and buttons to prevent text truncation while maintaining a "Call to Action" (CTA) tone appropriate for e-commerce.

Brand Integrity: Strategic balance between translating functional terms (e.g., "Figures" to "Colecionáveis") and preserving global sub-brands (e.g., "Sitting Cuties," "SQUISHMALLOWS").

📁 Portfolio Structure
Source: Original HTML (EN-US).
Localized: Final HTML (PT-BR).
Context and Bilingual: Detailed editorial rationale and linguistic QA decisions, and MemoQ bilingual file.

Note: Not all textual elements are visible in the original and final HTML (eg. submenus) because these are just static pages hosted at GitHub (and they require the native hosting infrastructure to work). However, the hidden elements are provided in the Bilingual file.
